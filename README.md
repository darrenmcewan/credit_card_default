# credit_card_default
Creating models to predict whether a client will default on their next payment.

Write a short report explaining your best ensemble model and the evaluation of that model. Consider what metrics you should use to evaluate your model. At a minimum you should report F1 scores, ROC curve, and AUC, but you might also want to consider using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, recall, precision, sensitivity, specificity, false positives, false negatives, Matthews correlation coefficient etc. Please justify the evaluation metric(s) that you use.
